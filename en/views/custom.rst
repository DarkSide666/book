Customizing Templates
=====================

This chapter explains a best practice on how you should use templates in your
Agile Toolkit application. It's important that you understand how
templates and view rendering views work in general it is more important that
you use apply your knowledge correctly.


Getting Started
---------------

Agile Toolkit application you have just started comes with default set of
templates. There exists a template for any view element (except AbstractView).

.. note:: The HTML templates use :doc:`/css` for formatting output. While it is possible
    to use a different CSS framework, you would need to supply HTML code for
    views yourself. This documentation will not cover that area.
