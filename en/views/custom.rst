Getting Started
---------------

Agile Toolkit application you have just started comes with default set of
templates. There exists a template for any view element (except AbstractView).

.. note:: The HTML templates use :doc:`/css` for formatting output. While it is possible
    to use a different CSS framework, you would need to supply HTML code for
    views yourself. This documentation will not cover that area.

To customize Look of Agile Toolkit you can use several strategies:

- Create a custom :doc:`/css/theme`.
- Use different or your own Layouts.
- Use pages with custom template.
- Creating custom views with your own template.
- Assigning classes to existing Views.
- Use special outline Views and composition.
